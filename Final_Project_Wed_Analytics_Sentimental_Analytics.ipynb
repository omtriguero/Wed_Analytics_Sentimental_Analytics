But caution and safety is absolutely needed as the laws aren’t very strict, and the police find it extremely hard to properly have safety everywhere due to the humongous population.

The whole infrastructure is too complicated for me to comprehend.  Dishonesty is the norm in exploiting tourists.  That being said I don’t want you to not visit India again.  I’d go with travel partners. Women are seen as inferior in general in my experiences travelling there.  I don’t see the hype over north India and Rajasthan it’s overrated IMO. North India has an eschewed sex ratio due to infanticide, selective sex abortions.  So they are very deprived of female attention.  Cultural norms too. If you’re American like me we are naturally friendly, well mannered. We may smile and say thank you to the wait staff at a restaurant but they might perceive it differently as flirting.  South India is so incredibly beautiful, and relatively safer. Mumbai is also decent. Have traveled there alone during rush hours on their local trains no issue.

Meghalaya is a great suggestion  but you cannot fly there so you will have to travel via car from Guwahati, Assam  to Meghalaya (about 2+ hours along cliff faces. Please research that trip as it is the definition of white knuckling.)I love Shilong and highly recommend it.

I’ve noticed a lot of people travel to the capital, Delhi, expecting it to safe, which is the case in most countries. Unfortunately geographically the capital is overflowing with migrants from surrounded areas that are not quite as well to do and lack education and exposure. Most of their exposure to the west presumably comes from porn, Hollywood, and their community, which isn’t any better informed. When there’s such a large population, a lot of issues get amplified, especially when looking from the outside in, like how most people view the situation with guns, from outside the US.

Also due to the housing crisis you sometimes get people living in the hostel because they are struggling to find housing, which isn’t something I’ve encountered elsewhere (in many places they wouldn’t even be allowed). It lowers the vibe enough when it’s someone who moved there for the ski season and hasn’t found a rental yet, but it’s really heartbreaking to learn that your roommate in the hostel isn’t there for a fun trip, but because they have been sleeping in the library since they got kicked out of their last rental but it’s closed for the holidays and they don’t want to spend Christmas out in the cold. \n",

I'm very excited to know that the culture over there may be closer to what I experienced this time. I stayed at a hostel in Detroit a month ago where most of the people were living there.

I like to freestyle my travel and I can jump in on other peoples lives if they invite me to do cool stuff. It’s not about solitude alone. My me time is just that. The rest is venturing out and socializing with randoms and seeing what their day is gonna turn into.\n",

Once you crack true Independence as a state of mind , I promise you’ll never give a shit about seeing young couples, spending your time drinking , looking for people to hang out with, etc etc.  you’ll also find you’ll join in with others easier when not overanalysing the need to do so.

They give you a chance to be with the same people doing the same activity over a period of time and give you a chance to connect with them in some way.  Doesn't mean you'll make a friend or really click with anyone, but you'll have more of a chance to that you might in a big crowd with everyone moving around.  Examples - on a cruise alone I went to a \"high tea\" and was randomly sat with a couple from Texas who I really enjoyed talking to and went to a few things together.  In Peru I did chocolate tour and make-your-own chocolate bar and got to know a couple of people a bit better, but nothing came of it.  And if you have money there are of course bigger tours and excursions and cookie classes, but there are briefer and budgetary ones as well.  If you're in a place for awhile and not briefly as a tourist, look for activities that occur regularly so you can become familiar with a group of people.\n",

It's not the first time it ever happened in the world and people can relate, small comfort that it is.\n",
            "----------- I just find openings to conversation. Like you’re both ordering at the bar, ask them what they’re getting cuz you can’t decide. You can usually tell right away if someone is open to chatting or not. If there’s sports on talk to the people rooting for one team or another, “that your team? They got this?” There’s an event going on “you here for the show?” Most people want to talk about the things they enjoy. Just look for things to start a conversation about. You’ll get a vibe if they don’t wanna chat and then back off and don’t be weird. But a lot of times people are nice and you can hang.\n",
            "------------ I like artsy hobbies so when I travel I tend to take whatever hobby I'm currently into. A little travel paint set was the most fun for being alone and interacting with my environment. But when I took my embroidery people came up to me and it was a good way to start a conversation. When I go on solo trips I plan at least one \"date\" where I dress up and go somewhere that gas food I really want to taste and force myself to slow down and eat it almost like I'm meditating. One time the place I went had a flower district so spent the morning getting there (most of my traveling is on a budget so I had to take the bus) and bought a couple bundles of discount flowers and when I got back where I was staying I made a bouquet. Also I recommend having at least a loose schedule of what you might want to do each day\n",

            "------------- This! Couldnt agree more. I did some solo travel back then when i was single (now a mother with young son), with the purpose of being alone. It felt refreshing. You dont need to adjust to your companions agreement of where and when to travel. You get lost yourself and maybe meeting new people along the way. I dont know maybe it also has something to do with your personality? I am quite an introvert so i was really fine even loved it. Maybe youre extrovert so it drained you. Now i have a son i loved travel alot with him without my spouse. Well my son usually just follow whatever I plan to do. It's quite different sometimes doing it with youe spouse lol.\n",

            "Reading through the comments here, there’s been some really fair points made and I think it’s important to acknowledge that there’s a difference between being ‘alone’ and ‘lonely’…its a sliding scale from going between both feelings, it’s just part of being a human and as social beings, we all experience it. I’ve been travelling as a solo female for 9 months now, and there’s been moments when I’ve felt really, really fucking lonely and watching other travellers have fun in their couples of groups has been so hard. But the majority of the time? I’ve loved the solitude and have found solo travelling so fun in comparison to when I went travelling with my (now ex) boyfriend a few years ago. \n",
            "But even as someone who loves her own company, I remember right at the beginning of the trip it took me such a long time to embrace it and really enjoy the alone time. there were so many questions in my head of ‘what the fuck am I doing here?!’ \n",
            "The other thing with solo travel which I don’t think people realise is that it’s a lot of saying ‘goodbye’. I’ve met so many lovely people on my travels, vibed with them for a few days/ weeks but have then had to say goodbye as they are going home/ or I am heading to the next destination etc. that’s also really hard! But, it’s also the beauty of travelling. It’s a constant flow of people and experiences and the more you do it, the more you can learn! \n",
            "\n",
            "Another thing to add is that also I think there’s a big fantasy about travelling but it’s really intense doing it by yourself. And whilst it’s such a great opportunity to grow as a person, if you’ve got stuff already going on with you, it will catch up with you eventually. I had a very difficult time last summer due to losing someone very close to me, and I didn’t deal with the grief with very well. since travelling that grief only intensified and there were times when I couldn’t enjoy where I was, no matter how hard I tried to ‘live in the moment’ \n",

The hard part of a hostel is that you need to know you’ll probably only meet the people there during that time period.

Of course social interaction and connection is key for humans, hence staying in social hostels, but if you’re going on a trip alone you need to be able to be happy alone.

Best advice I can give is do some research and find “social hostels” this doesn’t mean the cheapest possible options usually. The good ones hold heaps of activities to meet people and you do need to put yourself out there and try, don’t expect people to be lining up to be your friend if your a decent guy and can have a laugh thats who people want to be around. Meeting people at bars is so so easy. Just need the confidence to walk upto someone and say hi and exchange socials and if you get alone plan to do something in the next couple days.

I try to enjoy the daily life doing the stuff i like and some times i meet some really nice people, but as the top comment says the goal has not been to meet them, they just show up along the way. Ive also felt very alone sometimes but i try to look at it another way, as a way of learning about myself, about my limits. Many times its about being a bit lucky with people you find but most of the times its just about being confident. If you just start talking to people and they seem nice and you ask them to join them on theyre plans that day 90% of the time they will say yes and you get these amazing experiences and anecdotes. If you look for a couple you are gonna suffer because that isnt the same as with friends. You arent true with yourself, you try to get the other one to like you and that doesnt always work. Ive noticed that the best ways of finding someone like that is to get to know them through the day by joining theyre friend group idealy and then kinda try connecting with that one person you liked. But again, you have to try not making it about that, its about having fun, that comes second. If you dont take it like that and you dont take chances constantly then the days are empty.\n",

Whose fault is it if you don’t have a skill? Your parents? Your own? The education system? Society/institutions at large? Probably a bit of everything, but all in all I’d say that as a society we just haven’t figured out how to socialize even though we have no need to - previously most social interaction was out of necessity. All human beings are born as social creatures with a desire to connect, if they can’t do that en masse imo that’s an issue with their environment.\n",

Again, nobody is actually blaming people for being depressed or having mental health problems. They are blamed for their shortsighted decision that then pollutes this sub.\n",
            "--- Very much agree. I think people sometimes forget that a lot of solo travelers are solo because that's their only option -- they're single, or lonely, or don't have friends/family with flexible schedules, etc. They go because they still want to have an experience, see different parts of the world, but the loneliness doesn't magically disappear. So they come on here to vent, seek connection, and then people judge them for it. Travel is about many things -- getting out of your comfort zone, trying new food, seeing nature, art, architecture, music, learning different languages, exploring different cultures, on and on and on. But the element that runs through all of that is -people-. I've seen some say \"Solo travelers have unrealistic expectations about meeting people/making friends. That's not what it's about!\" Why the heck not?\n",

It's not even about being single or not, just that solo travel for the freedom and sheer fun of it is quite different from solo travel because you are achingly lonely and don't want to not do things because of it, so you try to do them alone and find out that connection and companionship are actually really really REALLY important. Generally, I mean. For me personally - even when I traveled with the express intention of getting out of my comfort zone with no one to lean on, my favorite memories from that trip were the people I met and stay close-ish with. \"I find joy in my own company and short lived connections are enough\" is all well and good, but it's not really enough. For a while, maybe. But if you solo travel because you'd rather not be solo but you'd prefer solo to staying home, of course you're sad. it's not a failing either. reddit does select for sad people, but it also selects for people who genuinely don't desire warm companionship as much as most do. don't feel bad if you feel lonely. < 3\n",

The price often filters out teens that are just looking for a place to stay but it also helps you support a smaller hostel whose whole purpose is to be social usually. \n",

Sometimes you click with people and meet some other awesome travellers and sometimes you don't. Part of solo travelling is getting comfortable with travelling solo. If you meet people it's a wonderful bonus, but if you set out with that being your goal and expectation you will likely end up disappointed (as you are finding) because you never know what you will get (life is like a box of chocolates yada yada). My suggestion is to do what you want to do and go where you want to go, being guided by your own curiosity and enjoy your own company, while still try and socialise where you can and make those connections.

You'll waste a lifetime waiting on other people to get their 💩 together to travel. Tell them that! It's true! I just smh at people waiting on family, friends, significant others to take that trip. Why? These people will never get their finances, schedule, or even passport together.  Just go, live your life, and let them hate. When you get older you'll have cool memories of the places you've been. When they get older they'll have regrets 💯.\n",

I spent so much time waiting for him to take me to do the things I wanted to do. I spent a long time waiting to have a partner to do the things I love. Now I don’t wait anymore for that. I just do the things I want to do. If in the future I meet someone who wants to join me in my adventures then great, if not, great. I’m no longer waiting! There is nothing wrong with traveling on your own. It’s actually better in my opinion. I do it all the time for work anyway, and I get to go places I love.\n",

When she was in high school, her mother became very ill, and she had to drop out of school to take care of her. Then she married young, but her husband was very abusive. After many years, she gained the courage to leave him. Living on her own, she went back to school and got her high school equivalency. Then, applied to University, and was accepted and graduated. When I met her, she was in the process of completing her PhD in botany. She said, \"Everyone is always concerned about the dangers of traveling alone.

You don’t die (at least not right away) you can go out and be around people and it’s ok. Also solo travel isn’t necessarily for everyone.
